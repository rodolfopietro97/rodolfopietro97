👋 I'm Rodolfo Pietro Calabrò, **Senior Software Developer.**

💞️ I have enjoyed Computer Science since I was 13 years old, and it was love at first sight.

🌱 This subject is very wide, but my main areas of interest remain **Blockchain Technologies and Distributed Systems**, **Software / Web Development (Full Stack)** and **Research**

:computer: Anyway, in general, I'm open to any kind of innovative type of project, that's because I enjoy creating new things and I strongly believe in innovation.
I've put my passion under many experiences in a lot of projects from Blockchain Technologies and Parallel Calculus to Frontend and Game Design.

Programming and learning new technologies, by the way, is, of course, an everyday challenge

- Like everybody I have some professional goals such as:
* Learning
* Innovating and Creating
* Be happy about getting up from my bed saying *"How beautiful today is. I will work on something I love."*
